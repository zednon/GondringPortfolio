<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>One of the main problems is how to get New Yorkers to know they can get to location that isn't the subway line.</p>

<h2>The Research</h2>

<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
<p>I reviewed Pax unplugged site. They run a large game board cofferinces the parent company runs events that included Pax which has over 70k guest at both east and west coast events. As well as New York Comic Con which hosts 200k guest. I wanted to review how a great company and runs events lays out their website.</p>

<h2>Interivews</h2>
<p>From prior events the group has done I reviewed user pain points they had when the group used to host a conference in Laconia NH </p>
<p>One of the leading issues they had with ticket sells was location and how people would feel they could get to the location</p>

<h2>Persona and Journey Map</h2>
<p>From the data I had review here is my User Persona and Empathy Map</p>
